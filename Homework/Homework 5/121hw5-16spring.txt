NOTE:  Please follow your lab instructor's directions for submitting your 
assignment through CSNET.  ONLY ASSIGNMENTS SUBMITTED TO CSNET WILL BE GRADED!
Make a printout of each source file and staple it behind this cover sheet, 
unless your lab instructor directs otherwise.  Sign it and give it to your TA 
in lab or put it in your TA's mailbox in the corner of the 3rd floor of HRBB, 
near room 312, by 5:00 P.M. Thursday.  IF YOU DO NOT TURN IN A SIGNED COVER 
SHEET YOUR WORK WILL NOT BE GRADED!

NOTE:  Homework will be graded on build.tamu.edu using g++ 5.3.0 with 
-std=c++14.  You are free to develop your programs on Visual C++ or any other 
platform, but it is your responsibility to make sure your programs also compile
and execute correctly on build.tamu.edu using g++ -std=c++14.

NOTE:  Each file submitted (hw5pr1.cpp, etc.--see below) must begin as follows:
//Your Name
//CSCE 121-xxx (fill in your section number)
//Due: March 23, 2016 (or whatever the due date is)
//hw5pr1.cpp (or whatever this file name is)

The grade for this lab will be based on style (formatting, variable names, 
comments, etc.), syntax (no compilation or link errors), and correctness 
(passes all test cases).  Follow the style guide at
http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/PPP-style.pdf. Your grade for this lab is:

 Grand total _____/30

1. (10 points)  Exercise 7 at the end of Chapter 12.  Name your program hw5pr1.cpp.  
Use several colors and feel free to be creative!

Draw a two-dimensional house seen from the front, the way a child would: with a door, two
windows, and a roof with a chimney. Feel free to add details; maybe have “smoke” come out of
the chimney.

2. (20 points)  Write a program named hw5pr2.cpp to draw a correct Texas flag 
using rectangles, closed polylines, and/or polygons (not images).  To draw a white 
5-pointed star, first do a little trig to calculate the vertices and then map 
those points to window coordinates.  Note: The official proportions of the Texas
flag are as follows: each colored panel (red, white, and blue) has dimensions 
in the ratio 1 to 2, e.g., the blue panel is twice as tall as it is wide.

OPTIONAL EXTRA CREDIT
=====================
3. (10 points) Write a C++/FLTK program that draws a checkerboard with
pieces.  The image at

should serve as the model for your program. For the checker
pieces, make them white and red, with a black outline, as shown in
the picture. For the board, you will need to create your own Color
objects. Look up the RGB values for "moss green" and "cherry blossom
pink"; use them for the background board like this:

Color moss_green(fl_rgb_color(R,G,B));

Change the color of the green squares to "moss green" and change the
cream-colored squares to "cherry blossom pink."  Name your program
hw5pr3.cpp.
